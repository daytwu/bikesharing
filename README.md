Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to see if there can be any insights found on one cities bike sharing program (NYC CitiBikes) so that light can be shed on investment decisions for another city. This is done by analyzing the user datas for this program for a particular month of the year to see if any trends can be found.

Results:

1st Analysis: The above image shows the starting locations of all the bike stations in our data. This is mapped with the stations longtitude and lattitude and then colored/enlarged by the size count of the rides itself. The image itself is Manhattan in NYC, this shows that dense metropolitan areas are a good start to look into when it comes to the initial steps of investment funding for bike stations for another dense metropolitan area.
