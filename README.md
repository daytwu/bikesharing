Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to see if there can be any insights found on one cities bike sharing program (NYC CitiBikes) so that light can be shed on investment decisions for another city. This is done by analyzing the user datas for this program for a particular month of the year to see if any trends can be found.

Results:

1st Analysis: The above image shows the starting locations of all the bike stations in our data. This is mapped with the stations longtitude and lattitude and then colored/enlarged by the size count of the rides itself. The image itself is Manhattan in NYC, this shows that dense metropolitan areas are a good start to look into when it comes to the initial steps of investment funding for bike stations for another dense metropolitan area.

The above analysis is a deeper look into the ride durations for the Users as a whole and users split by genders. This shows that Males uers tends to have a longer ride duration compared to Females or the unknown genders, with 5 hours peaking for Males and total users.

This image showcases the peak hours for the starting time during the month of August. According to the image, 7AM to 9AM is the most popular morning hours and 4PM to 7PM  is the most popular evening hours, with the evening hours being the more popular one with more people riding. On the other hand, 3AM and 4AM has the least amount of riders, which brings us to the next image.

This image showcases all the available Bike IDs within our data and displayed in a grouped count by the IDs itself. This is a quick and easy way to put focus on Bike Utilizations and can better prepare us in terms of which bike would require more maintenance due to higher usage.

These images showcases which days of the week has more ride usages. This is another way to look at the peak hours, with the data being set into a heatmap format. 

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)
Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)
